All MRI slices are shown in radiological convention. Volumetric analyses (Philippi et al. 2012) reveal that his lesion encompasses 90 % of the insula, 99 % of the ACC, and 100 % of the amygdala. The lesion extends beyond these regions into other limbic territories with more extensive damage in the right hemisphere. The entire right insula is destroyed and the damage in the posterior sector extends into parietal operculum, secondary somatosensory cortex, and the underlying white matter. The vast majority of the left insula is also destroyed with the exception of a small island of tissue in the left dorsal anterior insula that appears to be functionally disconnected from the rest of the brain (Philippi et al. 2012). Although the ACC has been destroyed bilaterally, the more dorsal and posterior aspects of Brodmann area 32 appear to be spared in the left hemisphere; however, this remaining tissue is dorsal to the paracingulate sulcus, and is therefore considered part of the paracingulate cortex (and not the ACC proper).

In the middle column cross-correlation analysis for the averaged single-subject time-course is displayed, showing remarkably similar trends to that of the spectral analysis. On the right column, the continuous auditory stimulation was analyzed by dividing it in a random effect general linear model (RFX-GLM) into low, medium and high frequency tone conditions. The GLM map displays the contrast of each frequency band with the other conditions. B. (left hemisphere) and E. (right hemisphere) display cross-correlation (middle) and GLM (right) analyses for Exp. 2 (n = 5) in which the chirp was reversed (i.e. from high to low frequencies).

A) An illustration of the Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer. Doxorubicin is conjugated to the dendrimer terminal amines by a pH-sensitive hydrazone bond, which facilitates the rapid release of doxorubicin following particle endocytosis into brain tumor cell lysosomal compartments. B) Annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy image of Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimers. C) In vitro fluorescence microscopy of cultured RG-2 glioma cells incubated for 4 hours in media containing Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimers at a 600 nM concentration. The red fluorescence in the cytoplasm represents Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimers within the cytoplasm of RG-2 glioma cells. The red fluorescence within the RG-2 cell nuclei represents free doxorubicin that has been released from the Gd-G5-doxorubicn dendrimers following cleavage of the hydrazone bond, since particles larger than Gd-G2 dendrimers are too large to pass through the nuclear pores. D) T2-weighted anatomic scan image and T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scan Gd concentration map images at various time points up to 60 minutes following Gd-G5-doxorubicn dendrimer infusion. The Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer was administered intravenously over 2 minutes at a Gd dose of 0.09 mmol Gd/kg, which is equivalent to a doxorubicin dose of 8 mg/kg. The T2-weighted anatomic scan image shows the location of the RG-2 glioma in the right caudate of rat brain, which has a tumor volume of 16 mm3. The first T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scan image displays the lack of contrast enhancement prior to Gd-G5 doxorubicin dendrimer infusion. The second T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scan image confirms contrast enhancement in the vasculature immediately after Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer infusion. The third T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scan image shows that at 60 minutes following the Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer infusion there is significant Gd-G5-doxorubicin accumulation within the RG-2 glioma tumor extravascular extracellular space, which confirms that the Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer has extravasated slowly across the BBTB over timer due to its long blood half-life. The white arrow highlights that there is positive contrast enhancement of normal brain tissue, which indicates that there is extravasation of the Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer across the normal BBB. E) Percent change in RG-2 malignant glioma volume within 24 hours. One group of orthotopic RG-2 glioma bearing animals received one intravenous 8 mg/kg dose of Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer with respect to doxorubicin (n = 7), and the other group of glioma bearing animals received one 8 mg/kg dose of free doxorubicin (n = 7). Pre-treatment whole RG-2 glioma tumor volumes calculated based on initial T2-weighted anatomic scans acquired immediately prior to agent administration, and post-treatment whole RG-2 glioma tumor volumes calculated based on repeat T2-weighted anatomic scans acquired within 22 ± 2 hours for the Gd-G5-doxorubicin group and 24 ± 1 hour for the free doxorubicin group. One dose of the Gd-G5-doxorubicin dendrimer is significantly more effective than one dose of free doxorubicin at inhibiting the growth of orthotopic RG-2 malignant gliomas for approximately 24 hours. Student's two-tailed paired t-test p value < 0.0008.","Bottom Line:Small molecule systemic chemotherapy drugs maintain peak blood concentrations for only minutes, and therefore, do not accumulate to therapeutic concentrations within individual brain tumor cells.Spherical nanoparticles ranging between 7 nm and 10 nm in diameter maintain peak blood concentrations for several hours and are sufficiently smaller than the 12 nm physiologic upper limit of pore size in the blood-brain tumor barrier to accumulate to therapeutic concentrations within individual brain tumor cells.Herein I discuss this novel strategy to improve the effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy for the treatment of malignant brain tumors and the therapeutic implications thereof.",https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/150/397/2743638/PMC2743638_1479-5876-7-77-5.png
